        I'm "formally" trained as a mathematician - however, I quickly fell in
        love with the utility of software engineering. Being able to turn an
        idea into reality is a great feeling! I now spend my professional time,
        and fair bit of my personal time, using a computer to create useful
        things.

        My forte is in full-stack web development (and mobile development using
        React Native), but I'm not afraid of learning new things. I focus on
        using JavaScript tooling to create data-driven applications.
